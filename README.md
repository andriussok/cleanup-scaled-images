# Cleanup Scaled Images
<strong> Wordpress plugin </strong>

If the original image width or height is above the threshold, it will be scaled down and the image will be used as the largest available "full" size; Original image will be added to uploads folder and included to attachment metadata. The plugin deletes all originals from the uploads folder, making WP projects lighter, easier to backup and migrate.
