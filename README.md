# Cleanup Scaled Images
<strong> Wordpress plugin </strong>

If the original image width or height is above the threshold, it will be scaled down and image will be used as the largest available "full" size; Original image will be added to uploads folder and included to attachment metadata. The plugin deletes all originals from uploads folder, making WP project lighter, easier to backup and migrate.
